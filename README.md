# Todo with Auth and Caching

The purpose of this project, is to practice with an API that has authentication, and user data CRUD,
and use caching techniques.

You will want to use the splash screen to call the API and update the todos in the local database (
so the cache is routinely getting refreshed). Only the local todos with be shown in view. When you
add or update the todo, make the call to the API first. If the API call went through successfully,
only then update the local cache to reflect this change.

Use compose, retrofit, room, datastore and your choice of compose navigation library.
